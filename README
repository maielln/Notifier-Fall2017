For this program, I decided to utilize an interface instead of superclasses
because I believed it would be best to have the Notifier interface keep track
of each function. This notifier keeps track of the generateID, setAlarm, and
doAlarm functions, which all three classes utilize. In the tester class, it
creates one object of each type and keeps the program running until it has
reached 100000000 milliseconds. Each class can also do their own object
specific function.
